Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:


Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.


When you're ready to deploy, use the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.


Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.


On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the main branch as your source.


Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.
