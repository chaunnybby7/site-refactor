# site-refactor

## Introduction
For this project, I am to make sure the acceptance criteria are met and fix any issues on the website.

## What changes I have made :

1)Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

2)Fixed the code by adding missing "id" to search-engine-optimization.

3)Added alt texts to all images. 

4)Renamed title of the website. 

## User Story 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
